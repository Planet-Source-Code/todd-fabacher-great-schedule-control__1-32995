## Great Schedule Control

### Description

Here is a great little piece of code that will be VERY useful for anyone needing to schedule something. The interface is based on SQL Server’s schedule, but the code is 100% VB. It will schedule almost all possibilities.

Included is XML code because I am also coming out with a Web version based on (XML/XSL) with VB or ASP in the back to calculate the Next Time. So if there is interest for the web, just let me know.

** After reading a comment about not enough professional business code samples on PCS, I thought it time that I contribute. I have use many samples from here over the years and I just wanted to give back.

Enjoy!!!
